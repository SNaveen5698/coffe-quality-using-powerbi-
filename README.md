Title:
"Decoding Coffee Quality: Insights from Power BI Analysis"

Summary:
This project utilized Power BI to analyze data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), aiming to understand factors influencing coffee quality. We explored sensory attributes, processing methods, origin regions, defect occurrences, and their impact on Total Cup Points. Key findings include determinants of quality, correlations between processing/origin and quality, defect trends, and predictive insights for coffee quality enhancement.

Methodology:

Data Exploration: Cleaned and prepared CQI dataset for analysis.
Feature Analysis: Examined sensory attributes and their relationship with Total Cup Points.
Correlation Study: Investigated links between processing methods, origin regions, and quality scores.
Defects Assessment: Analyzed primary and secondary defects' impact on overall quality.
Predictive Modeling: Developed models to forecast Total Cup Points based on variables.
Achievements:

Identified sensory attributes driving coffee quality.
Established correlations between processing/origin and quality.
Uncovered defect trends and predictive insights for quality improvement.
